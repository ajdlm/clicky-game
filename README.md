# Cowboy Bebop Memory Game

A simple memory game that tests the user's ability to avoid clicking on the same image twice.

## How to Play

* Try to click on as many images as possible without clicking on the same image twice.

* Each time you click on a new image, a point will be added to your score.

* However, if you accidentally click on the same image a second time, you will lose and the game will restart.

* When this happens, if your score is higher than your previous top score, it will replace it.

* Likewise, if you successfully manage to click on every portrait without clicking twice on a single one, the game will restart, replacing your previous top score with the number 12 -- the highest score possible.

## Technologies Used

* HTML/CSS

* Bootstrap 4

* JavaScript

* React
